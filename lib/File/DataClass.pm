File::DataClass - Structured data file IO with caching and searching

=head1 Version

This document describes version v0.73.$Rev: 2 $ of L<File::DataClass>

=head1 Synopsis

   use File::DataClass::Schema;

   $schema = File::DataClass::Schema->new
      ( path    => [ 'path to a file' ],
        result_source_attributes => { source_name => {}, },
        tempdir => [ 'path to a directory' ] );

   $schema->source( 'source_name' )->attributes( [ qw( list of attr names ) ] );
   $rs = $schema->resultset( 'source_name' );
   $result = $rs->find( { name => 'id of field element to find' } );
   $result->$attr_name( $some_new_value );
   $result->update;
   @result = $rs->search( { 'attr name' => 'some value' } );

=head1 Description

Provides methods for manipulating structured data stored in files of
different formats

The documentation for this distribution starts in the class
L<File::DataClass::Schema>

L<File::DataClass::IO> is a L<Moo> based implementation of L<IO::All>s API.
It implements the file and directory methods only

=head1 Configuration and Environment

=head1 Incompatibilities

On C<mswin32> and C<cygwin> it is assumed that NTFS is being used and
that it does not support C<mtime> so caching on those platforms is
disabled

Due to the absence of an C<mswin32> environment for testing purposes that
platform is not supported
